F1 telemetry using Gemini API I need a wow moment on combining F1 idea from my 310 class low latency C++ google Gemini API. F1 teams run thousands of simulations sending millions to optimize everything they can and yet there is only one winner. Every great leader has a great #2 MJ had Scotty, iron man had jarvis. This idea that all of the greats have a great number two transcends niches. Soul would hurt to give you another AI, lovable V0 slop front end. So I limited my scope to something I'm really passionate about. I hope I did alright to convey that F1 plus JARVIS equals FARVIS. What does it stand for? Fast, adaptable, reliable. Visionary. Insanely stupendous.
I need some sort of, I don't know, wow moment, probably to impress the judges. What can that be? I could change aggression and then within two seconds Gemini changes the pit call with reasons. Or for the yeah, that could be a good idea.

I need some sort of, I don't know, wow moment, probably to impress the judges. What can that be? I could change aggression and then within two seconds Gemini changes the pit call with reasons. Or for the yeah, that could be a good idea. What does does is navigate uncertainty, fast and slow. AI. We talked about this in CMPT 310 you might say which one do you need? We actually need both for something to process it and to give you an actionable insight to the driver is just not possible. These things are done at like a millionth of a 2nd and yeah.
