## Architecture

The system uses a producer-consumer architecture with a thread-safe ring buffer:

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│ Telemetry       │         │   Ring       │         │   Consumer      │
│ Generator       │────────▶│   Buffer     │────────▶│   Thread        │
│ (Producer)      │         │  (1024 cap)  │         │   (Display)     │
└─────────────────┘         └──────────────┘         └─────────────────┘
```

### Components

- **TelemetryGenerator**: Generates telemetry frames for all 20 drivers every 20ms, simulating speed, tire wear, sector progression, and race positions. Implements driver skill factors and variable pit stop strategies.
- **RingBuffer**: Thread-safe circular buffer using condition variables (`std::condition_variable`) for efficient blocking instead of busy-waiting. Supports graceful shutdown mechanism.
- **StrategyAnalyzer**: Optional pre-race strategy module that searches for an optimal pit lap for selected drivers.
- **RaceSimulator**: Lightweight race simulation used by the strategy analyzer to evaluate pit lap candidates.
- **TrackLimitsMonitor**: Monitors track limits violations, checking at sector boundaries for realistic frequency. Tracks warnings and penalties per driver with thread-safe access.
- **PenaltyEnforcer**: Thread-safe penalty state machine. Stores penalties per driver and is consulted by the telemetry generator to add penalty time during pit stops.
- **Main Application**: Orchestrates strategy analysis (optional), track limits monitoring, and the producer/consumer threads, and renders the live race leaderboard.

## Building

## Usage

1. **Run the simulator**:
   ```bash
   ./f1-telemetry
   ```

2. **(Optional) Run optimal strategy analysis**:
   - When prompted, type `y`
   - Enter driver indices (comma-separated, no spaces), e.g. `4,6,1`
   - The program prints the chosen pit lap per selected driver
   - Then it prints the full list of strategies that will be used and waits for **Enter** before starting the race

2. **View the live race**: The terminal displays a beautiful, color-coded leaderboard:
   ```
   🏁 LAP 15/50 🏁
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   P1 🔴 Charles Leclerc      █████████░ Lap 15  Speed: 210 kph  Tire: 25%

Models driver behavior characteristics:
- `aggression`: Affects tire wear rate (0.0 - 1.0)
- `consistency`: Lap time variance (0.0 - 1.0)
- `tire_management`: Resistance to tire degradation (0.0 - 1.0)
- `risk_tolerance`: Willingness to take risks (0.0 - 1.0)

### CarProfile

- `engine_power`: Top speed capability (0.0 - 1.0)
- `aero_efficiency`: Cornering and downforce (0.0 - 1.0)
- `cooling_efficiency`: Tire temperature stability (0.0 - 1.0)
- `reliability`: Failure probability (0.0 - 1.0)

### TelemetryFrame
Contains per-frame race data:
- Race position, timestamp, driver ID
- Lap number, sector number
- Speed, throttle, brake inputs
- Tire temperatures (FL, FR, RL, RR)
- Tire wear percentage

### TrackProfile

- Number of sectors, lap length
- Tire wear factor
- Overtaking difficulty
- Safety car probability

## Example Configuration

The default configuration includes the full 2025 F1 grid with 20 drivers across 10 teams:

**Top Teams:**
- **Max Verstappen** (Red Bull): High aggression (0.88), exceptional consistency (0.98), excellent tire management (0.88)
- **Charles Leclerc** (Ferrari): Very aggressive (0.94), high consistency (0.96), good tire management (0.85)
- **Lando Norris** (McLaren): High aggression (0.82), excellent consistency (0.94), good tire management (0.86)
- **Oscar Piastri** (McLaren): Moderate aggression (0.74), excellent consistency (0.90), good tire management (0.84)

**Notable Situations:**
- **Lewis Hamilton** (Ferrari): Struggling with adaptation - reduced consistency (0.72) and tire management (0.78)
- **Yuki Tsunoda** (Red Bull): Rookie at top team - low consistency (0.58) and tire management (0.58)

## Technical Details

### Thread Safety & Synchronization
- **Condition Variables**: Ring buffer uses `std::condition_variable` for efficient blocking
  - `cv_not_empty_`: Consumer waits when buffer is empty (instead of busy-waiting)
  - Eliminates CPU spinning and reduces power consumption
- **Mutex Protection**: `std::mutex` with `std::unique_lock` for thread-safe operations
- **Graceful Shutdown**: `shutdown()` method notifies all waiting threads and prevents new operations
- **Atomic Flags**: Used for race finish detection and thread coordination

### Performance
- Ring buffer capacity: 1024 frames (configurable)
- Update rate: 50Hz (20ms per frame)
- Zero busy-waiting: Condition variables ensure threads sleep when waiting
- Low-latency design: Minimal blocking between producer and consumer
- Efficient wake-up: Only one thread notified per operation (`notify_one()`)

### Advanced Simulation Features
- **Driver Skill Factor**: Speed calculation includes `driver_skill = 0.80 + consistency * 0.25`, meaning consistent drivers extract more performance
- **Variable Pit Stop Thresholds**: Range from 65-90% tire wear based on:
  - Base: `0.65 + (tire_management * 0.25)`
  - Risk adjustment: `±7.5%` based on risk tolerance
- **Variable Pit Stop Duration**: 2-3 seconds based on car reliability
- **Position Calculation**: Real-time sorting by total distance (lap distance + distance in current lap)

## Implementation Highlights

### Condition Variables
The ring buffer implementation uses condition variables to eliminate busy-waiting:

```cpp
// Consumer waits efficiently when buffer is empty
cv_not_empty_.wait(lock, [this]() { 
    return head_ != tail_ || shutdown_;
});
```

The consumer sleeps when the buffer is empty, reducing CPU usage and improving system efficiency.

### Driver Performance Model
Driver consistency directly impacts speed:
- High consistency (0.95+): Can extract 100%+ of car performance
- Low consistency (0.60): Only extracts ~80% of car performance
- This creates realistic performance gaps between drivers

### Pit Stop Strategy
Each driver has a unique pit stop threshold:
- Tire management experts (0.95): Pit at ~90% wear
- Rookies (0.58): Pit at ~70% wear (more cautious)
- Risk-takers: Pit slightly earlier, conservative drivers later

### Optimal Strategy Analysis (how it works)
When enabled at startup, the program can compute an "optimal" pit lap for a subset of drivers and feed those pit laps into the live telemetry generator.

- **Candidate laps**: `StrategyAnalyzer::PIT_LAPS_TO_TEST` defines a small set of laps to evaluate (e.g. 12, 15, 18, ...).
- **Parallel evaluation**: For a given driver, the analyzer launches multiple simulations concurrently using `std::async(std::launch::async, ...)` and collects results with `std::future<float>`.
- **Selection**: The lap with the lowest simulated finish time is chosen and applied to the live race as a single planned pit stop for that driver.

### Track Limits Monitoring (how it works)
The `TrackLimitsMonitor` processes telemetry frames to detect track limits violations with realistic frequency and consequences.

- **Sector-based checking**: Violations are only checked at sector boundaries (not every frame), ensuring realistic frequency (approximately 3 checks per lap instead of 50 per second).
- **Violation probability factors**:
  - **Aggression**: `driver.aggression * 0.01` - More aggressive drivers push limits more often
  - **Speed**: `0.005` if speed > 200 kph - Higher speeds increase violation risk
  - **Tire wear**: `tire_wear * 0.01` if wear > 60% - Worn tires reduce control
- **Penalty system**: 
  - Each violation adds a warning and records the lap number
  - After **3 warnings**, the driver receives a penalty flag (`has_penalty = true`) and a time penalty is issued via `PenaltyEnforcer`
- **Thread safety**: Uses `std::mutex` to protect the violations map during concurrent access from producer and consumer threads

### Penalty Enforcer (how it works)
The `PenaltyEnforcer` is a thread-safe penalty state machine keyed by `driver_id`.

- **Issuing**: `issuePenalty(driver_id, seconds)` marks the penalty as `PENDING` and stores the duration.
- **Serving**: The live `TelemetryGenerator` consults `shouldServePenalty(driver_id, current_time_ns)` when a driver enters the pits; if `PENDING`, it switches to `SERVING` and timestamps the start using **simulation time (ns)**.
- **Completion**: `isPenaltyComplete(driver_id, current_time_ns)` only becomes true after the simulated duration elapses, then transitions to `SERVED`.
